<h2>About</h2>
<h3>I spend my day to day as a Program Analyst. I have always been interested in Hacking and Computer programming <br>
but sports always kept me busy. As I have progressed throughout my career of contracting and trying to work a typical <br>
job, the 9 to 5 grind wasn't for me. I started the Str8Rogue (aka Str8Rogue16) while contracting in Baghdad, Iraq in 2008. <br>
I have kept the name and looking to turn it into a brand that, for those of us that are different, can relate to be a Str8Rogue individual. <br>
<em>Str8Rogue</em> is more about a personality of doing things your way regardless of what others say. Many will say that its being a rebel <br>
or just hard headed. But some of us have a way of doing things that we enjoy and allows us the best way to learn. <br>
My interests span engineering to hacking to figure out how things work. it doesn't matter if it is a vehicle's motor or <br>
a website, I always have to figure out how to increase efficiency on them.
